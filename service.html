                <small>College Loan</small>
                <p>Personal loans generally come in two forms: secured and unsecured. Secured loans are backed by
                    collateral—such as a
                    savings account or a vehicle—that a lender can take back if you don’t repay your full loan amount.

                    Unsecured loans, on the other hand, require no collateral and are backed by your signature alone,
                    hence their alternate
                    name: signature loans. Unsecured loans tend to be more expensive and require better credit because
                    the lender takes on
                    more risk.

                    Applying for a personal loan is easy, and typically can be done online through a bank, credit union
                    or online lender.
                    Borrowers with excellent credit can qualify for the best personal loans, which come with low
                    interest rates and a range
                    of repayment options.</p>

                <small>Vacation Loan</small>
                <p>RV loans can either be unsecured or secured loans. Smaller RV loans are typically unsecured and work
                    similarly to a
                    personal loan while expensive, luxury RVs are secured—with the RV serving as collateral—and work
                    more like an auto loan.

                    Depending on the lender, you can find RV loans for around $25,000 that you repay over a few years,
                    but you also can find
                    loans up to $300,000 that you repay over 20 years.

                    RVs are fun and they can help you and your family enjoy quality time together. But it’s important to
                    keep depreciation
                    in mind, especially if you’re buying a new RV and you think you’ll be selling it at some point down
                    the line.</p>

                <small>Auto Loan</small>
                <p>Auto loans are a type of secured loan that you can use to buy a vehicle with repayment terms between
                    three to seven
                    years. In this case, the collateral for the loan is the vehicle itself. If you don’t pay, the lender
                    will repossess the
                    car.

                    You can typically get auto loans from credit unions, banks, online lenders and even car dealerships.
                    Some car
                    dealerships have a financing department where they help you find the best loan from partner lenders.
                    Others operate as
                    “buy-here-pay-here” lenders, where the dealership itself gives you the loan. These tend to be much
                    more expensive,
                    though.</p>

                <small>Mortgage Loan</small>
                <p>Mortgages help you finance the purchase of a home, and there are many types of mortgages available.
                    Banks and credit
                    unions are common mortgage lenders; however, they may sell their loans to a federally-sponsored
                    group like Fannie Mae or
                    Freddie Mac if it’s a qualified mortgage.</p>

                <small>Payday Loan</small>
                <p>Payday loans are a type of short-term loan, usually lasting just until your next paycheck. These
                    loans aren’t
                    credit-based, and so you don’t need good credit to qualify. However, these loans are often predatory
                    in nature, for a
                    couple of reasons.

                    First, they charge very high finance fees, which can work out to around 400% APR in some cases (the
                    finance fee isn’t
                    the same thing as an APR). Second, they allow you to roll over your loan if you can’t pay it off by
                    your next paycheck.
                    It sounds helpful at first—until you realize even more fees are tacked on, which trap a lot of
                    people in debt
                    obligations that can be higher than what they originally borrowed.</p>

                <small>Debt Consolidation Loan</small>
                <p>Debt consolidation lets you streamline your payments by applying for a new loan to pay off your other
                    debts, therefore
                    leaving you with only one monthly loan payment. If you have high-interest debts like credit cards or
                    a high-interest
                    personal loan, a debt consolidation loan can help you in two ways. First, you could qualify for a
                    lower monthly payment.
                    Second, you could qualify for lower rates, which can help you save money over the long term.

                    In order to get a debt consolidation loan that improves your payments, though, you’ll need to first
                    shop around for a
                    lower rate than your current loan or credit card. You’re also more likely to qualify if your credit
                    has improved since
                    you took out your current loan or card. Once you qualify, your lender may automatically pay the
                    debts for you, or you
                    will need to do it yourself.</p>

                <small>Credit builder Loan</small>
                <p>Credit-builder loans are small, short-term loans that are taken out to help you build credit. Since
                    they’re marketed
                    toward people with zero or limited credit, you don’t need good credit to qualify, unlike regular
                    loans. You can
                    typically find credit-builder loans at credit unions, community banks, Community Development
                    Financial Institutions
                    (CDFIs), lending circles or online lenders.

                    Instead of receiving the loan funds up front as you would on a traditional loan, you make fixed
                    monthly payments and
                    receive the money back at the end of the loan term. Credit-builder loans typically range between
                    $300 to $3,000 and
                    charge annual percentage rates (APRs) between 6% and 16%.</p>

                <small>Home equity Loan</small>
                <p>If you have equity in your home, you might be able to use a home equity loan, also known as a second
                    mortgage. The
                    equity you have in your home—the portion of your home that you own, and not the bank—secures the
                    loan. You can typically
                    borrow up to 85% of your home’s equity, which is paid out as a lump sum amount and repaid over five
                    to 30 years.

                    To find out your home’s equity, simply subtract your mortgage balance from your home’s assessed
                    value. For example, if
                    you owe $150,000 on your mortgage and your home is worth $250,000, then your equity is $100,000.
                    Considering the 85%
                    loan limit rule, and depending on your lender, you could potentially borrow up to $85,000 with
                    $100,000 in equity.</p>

                <small>Title Loan</small>
                <p>Title loans are another type of secured loan where you pledge the title for a vehicle you own—such as
                    a car, truck or
                    RV—as collateral. Your loan limit typically is anywhere between 25% to 50% of your car’s value,
                    evaluated by the lender.
                    Lenders that offer title loans also charge a monthly fee of 25% of the loan amount, which translates
                    to an annual
                    percentage rate (APR) of at least 300%, making these a costly financing option.</p>

                <small>Pawn shop Loan</small>
                <p>Pawnshop loans are another type of loan we usually don’t recommend because they’re very expensive,
                    have small loan
                    limits and require quick repayment. To get a pawnshop loan, you’ll bring something of value to the
                    pawnbroker, such as a
                    power tool, a piece of jewelry or a musical instrument.

                    The pawnbroker will assess the item, and if they offer you a loan, it’ll typically be worth 25% to
                    60% of the item’s
                    resale value. You’ll receive a pawn ticket, which you’ll need when you return to repay the loan,
                    typically within 30
                    days. If you don’t return, or if you lose your ticket, the pawnbroker gets to keep your item to
                    resell and recoup their
                    money.</p>

                <small>Boat Loan</small>
                <p>Boat loans are specifically designed to finance the purchase of a boat and are available through
                    banks, credit unions
                    and online lenders. The loans can either be unsecured or secured, with secured loans using your boat
                    as collateral. As
                    with any vehicle-related loan, it’s crucial to keep depreciation in mind.

                    Boats and other vehicles lose value over time, especially if you buy a new boat. If you choose a
                    long-term loan, don’t
                    make a very large down payment and/or sell your boat soon after you buy it, it’s possible to owe
                    more on the loan than
                    you can sell it for. This means you’ll need to keep paying off the loan even after you sell the
                    boat, and that’s not an
                    enviable position to be in.</p>
